# Trajectories of Success: Longitudinal Analysis of Educational Achievement in Irish Children

## Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and final paper for my MSc Statistics dissertation at University College Dublin. The study analyzes factors influencing educational achievement in Irish children using data from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study.

## Repository Contents
- `code/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling
- `data/`: Processed data files (original data not included due to privacy constraints)
- `paper/`: Final dissertation paper in PDF format
- `results/`: Output files, figures, and tables

## Key Features
- Analysis of multi-wave survey data covering 4653 children over a 9-year period
- Implementation of longitudinal mixed-effects models and machine learning methods (XGBoost, Random Forest)
- Predictive modeling of educational outcomes (64% accuracy, 0.654 F1 score)
- Innovative approaches to handle survey attrition and missing data

## Methodology
- Data Source: Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal study
- Statistical Techniques: Growth modeling, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression with LASSO
- Data Handling: Cross-referenced mode imputation, sensitivity analysis, dropout analysis

## Key Findings
- Child behavioral issues are the strongest predictor of educational outcomes
- Socioeconomic factors have a persistent impact on achievement
- Maternal education level significantly influences child educational outcomes
- Complex interactions between behavioral patterns and socioeconomic status are highly predictive
